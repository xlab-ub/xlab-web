    <p><span> Dr. Jinjun Xiong is an </span><span><strong>Empire Innovation Professor</strong></span><span> with the </span><span><a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering</a></span><span>, </span><span><a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/" target="_blank">University at Buffalo</a></span><span> (UB). He received his Ph.D. degree in 2006 from </span><span><a href="https://www.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Los Angeles</a></span><span> (UCLA) with an </span><span><em><strong>Outstanding Ph.D. Award</strong></em></span><span>, his M.S. degree from</span><span><a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Wisconsin, Madison</a></span><span> in 2002, and his M.S. and B.S. degrees from </span><span><a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm" target="_blank">Tsinghua University</a></span><span> in 2000 and 1998, respectively.</span></p>
    <p><span>Before joining UB in 2021, Dr. Xiong was Program Director and Senior Research Scientist at</span><span><a href="https://research.ibm.com/labs/watson/" target="_blank"> IBM T.J. Watson Research Center</a></span><span>, Yorktown Heights, NY.  He co-founded and co-directed the </span><span><a href="https://c3sr.com/" target="_blank">IBM-Illinois Center for Cognitive Computing Systems Research</a></span><span> with Prof. </span><span><a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/w-hwu" target="_blank">Wen-mei Hwu</a></span><span>. Under their leadership, the C3SR center has expanded from the early days' eight faculty members in 2016 to close to </span><span><a href="https://c3sr.com/participants/" target="_blank">40 faculty members</a></span><span> in 2021. The success of the C3SR center also led to the creation of the new </span><span><a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-05-26-IBM-and-the-University-of-Illinois-Urbana-Champaign-Plan-to-Launch-New-Discovery-Accelerator-Institute" target="_blank">IBM-Illinois Discovery Accelerator Institute</a></span><span>, a joint $200-million research investment between IBM and UIUC. Dr. Xiong also co-founded the </span><span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/news/ca/en/2012/10/25/s758316t94841i91.html" target="_blank">IBM Smarter Energy Research Institute</a></span><span> and led </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlfxOlkeL-M" target="_blank">a number of enterprise-scale collaborations</a></span><span> with world-wide electric utility companies to address sustainability issues with renewable integration. </span></p>
    <p><span>Dr. Xiong's recent research interests are on across-stack AI systems and solutions research, including:</span></p>
    <ul><li><p><span>Innovative AI applications, in particular on education and sustainability</span></p></li><li><p><span>Novel AI algorithms, in particular on computer vision and natural language processing</span></p></li><li><p><span>Productivity tooling for AI development, in particular on software engineering, compilers, and operating systems</span></p></li><li><p><span>AI accelerators and computer architectures for edge computing and hybrid clouds, such as </span><span> GPUs, and FPGAs</span></p></li></ul>
    <p><span>He has published more than 150 peer-reviewed papers in top AI conferences and systems conferences. His publication has won </span><span><em><strong>seven</strong></em></span><span> Best Paper Awards and </span><span><em><strong>eight</strong></em></span><span> Nominations for Best Paper Awards. Dr. Xiong also won top awards from various international competitions, including the recent </span><span><em><strong>Championship Award</strong></em></span><span> for the IEEE GraphChallenge on accelerating sparse neural networks, and the </span><span><em><strong>Championship Awards</strong></em></span><span> for the DAC'19 Systems Design Contest on designing an object detection neural network for both edge FPGA track and the edge GPU track. </span><span>Many of his research results have been adopted in commercial enterprise-scale products and tools.</span></p>
